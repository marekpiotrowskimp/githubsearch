# githubsearch
This project was created for proving the ability to write SWIFT code on iOS.

Company inFullMobile gave me a task which said: "Please write a native iOS application which allows the user to search through GitHub open source repositories. The application should have a text field in which the user enters a search phrase, a list which displays the search results and after user taps on a list item, the website of the repository should be displayed in a web browser."

Project can work on XCode 11.3.1, iOS 13.3, SWIFT 5.1 and was tested on iPhone 11 Pro Max

Please feel free to clone, modify and publish any part of this repository.
